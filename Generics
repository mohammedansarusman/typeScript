🚀 Leveling Up My TypeScript Game with Generics!
Today I dove into TypeScript Generics and started understanding how they help keep my code both flexible and type-safe. Here's a little snippet I played with 👇

type uDetails = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type aDetails = {
  fname: string;
  role: string;
};

const userDetails: uDetails = {
  name: "John",
  age: 40,
};

const adminDetails: aDetails = {
  fname: "Jeffry",
  role: "admin",
};

function getDetails<T>(details: T): T {
  return details;
}

const value1 = getDetails(userDetails);  // Hovering on value1 gives proper type suggestions!
const value2 = getDetails(adminDetails); // Same here 🎯

🧠 What I learned:

By using generics (<T>), I can preserve the type of whatever is passed into getDetails.

This helps avoid losing IntelliSense support and keeps my editor smart—like showing correct keys (name, age, fname, etc.) when I type value1. or value2.

It also avoids unnecessary union types (uDetails | aDetails) when I already know the type going in.

🛠️ This small tweak made a big difference. I'm loving how TypeScript helps me write better, safer, and more developer-friendly code.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Here the aDetails have no name and age string. this methid will help to show the uDetails attributes in aDetails type

type uDetails = {
    name?:string;
    age?:number;
}

type aDetails = uDetails &  {
    role?:string;
}

let userDetails: uDetails = {
    name:"Messi",
    age:40,
}

let adminDetails: aDetails = {
    name:"Carlose",
    age:34,
}

Here how the interface will work in same example

interface uDetails {
    name:string;
    age:number;
}

interface aDetails extends uDetails   {
    role?:string;
}

let userDetails: uDetails = {
    name:"Messi",
    age:40,
}

let adminDetails: aDetails = {
    name:"Carlose",
    age:34,
}
